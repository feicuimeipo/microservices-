# Claims - OpenID Connect Authentication

OpenID connect claims are treated as normal CAS attributes that need to
be [resolved, mapped and released](../integration/Attribute-Release-Policies.html).

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>ID Token Claims</strong><p>
Per OpenID Connect specification, individual claims requested by OpenID scopes,
such as <code>profile</code>, <code>email</code>, etc. are only put into the OpenID 
Connect ID token when the response type is set to <code>id_token</code>. To assist with 
backward compatibility and non-complying application integrations, CAS provides options to force-include
claims in the ID token, though please note that this should be a last workaround as doing so most likely
is in violation of the OpenID Connect specification. Claims should be requested from 
the userinfo/profile endpoints in exchange for an access token as indicated by the appropriate response type.
</p></div>

## Configuration

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.oidc.core" %}

## Scope-based Claims

You may chain various attribute release policies that authorize claim release based on specific scopes:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "...",
  "clientSecret": "...",
  "serviceId" : "...",
  "name": "OIDC Test",
  "id": 10,
  "scopes" : [ "java.util.HashSet", 
    [ "openid", "profile", "email", "address", "phone", "offline_access", "displayName", "eduPerson" ]
  ]
}
```

Standard scopes that internally catalog pre-defined claims all belong to 
the namespace `org.apereo.cas.oidc.claims` and are described below:

| Policy                                             | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `o.a.c.o.c.OidcProfileScopeAttributeReleasePolicy` | Release claims mapped to the spec-predefined `profile` scope. |
| `o.a.c.o.c.OidcEmailScopeAttributeReleasePolicy`   | Release claims mapped to the spec-predefined `email` scope.   |
| `o.a.c.o.c.OidcAddressScopeAttributeReleasePolicy` | Release claims mapped to the spec-predefined `address` scope. |
| `o.a.c.o.c.OidcPhoneScopeAttributeReleasePolicy`   | Release claims mapped to the spec-predefined `phone` scope.   |
| `o.a.c.o.c.OidcCustomScopeAttributeReleasePolicy`  | Release claims mapped to the CAS-defined `custom` scope.      |
   
You are encouraged to use scopes where possible, when deciding on the strategy to share attributes and claims with client applications. 
CAS will automatically translate scopes and bundled claims within each scope into the appropriate attribute release policy. If the oppurtunity
presents itself, avoid using an attribute release policy directly.

## Mapping Claims

Claims associated with a scope (i.e. `given_name` for `profile`) are fixed in 
the [OpenID specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html). In the 
event that custom arbitrary attributes should be mapped to claims, mappings can be defined in CAS 
settings to link a CAS-defined attribute to a fixed given scope. For instance, CAS configuration may 
allow the value of the attribute `sys_given_name` to be mapped and assigned to the claim `given_name` 
without having an impact on the attribute resolution configuration and all other CAS-enabled applications. 

If mapping is not defined, by default CAS attributes are expected to match claim names.

Claim mapping rules that are defined in CAS settings are global and apply to all applications and requests. Once a claim is mapped
to an attribute (i.e. `preferred_username` to `uid`), this mapping rule will take over all claim processing rules and conditions. It is
surely possible to specify claim mapping rules on a per application basis as well to override what is defined globally: 

```json
{
  "@class": "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "client",
  "clientSecret": "secret",
  "serviceId": "^https://...",
  "name": "Sample",
  "id": 1,
  "scopes" : [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "openid", "profile" ] ],
  "attributeReleasePolicy": {
    "@class": "org.apereo.cas.oidc.claims.OidcProfileScopeAttributeReleasePolicy",
    "claimMappings" : {
      "@class" : "java.util.TreeMap",
      "preferred_username" : "uid"
    }
  }
}
```
   
The above configuration will allow CAS to map the value of the `uid` attribute to the `preferred_username` claim that is constructed in response to 
an authentication request from application `Sample`. The claim mapping rule here is exclusive to this application only, and does not affect
any other application or global mapping rule, if any.

## User-Defined Scopes

Note that in addition to standard system scopes, you may define your own custom scope with a number of attributes within:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "...",
  "clientSecret": "...",
  "serviceId" : "...",
  "name": "OIDC Test",
  "id": 10,
  "scopes" : [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "displayName", "eduPerson" ] ]
}
```
 
These such as `displayName` above, get bundled into a `custom` scope which 
can be used and requested by services and clients.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Usage</strong><p>All user-defined custom scopes as well any custom claims
that would be mapped to those scopes must always be advertised via OpenID Connect discovery document and specified
in CAS settings for scopes and claims to be recognized as valid during claim processing.</p>
</div>

If you however wish to define your custom scopes as an extension of what OpenID Connect defines
such that you may bundle attributes together, then you need to first register your `scope`,
define its attribute bundle and then use it a given service definition such as `eduPerson` above.
Such user-defined scopes are also able to override the definition of system scopes.

## Releasing Claims

Defined scopes for a given service definition control and build attribute release policies internally. Such attribute release
policies allow one to release standard claims, remap attributes to standard claims, or define custom claims and scopes altogether. 

It is also possible to define and use *free-form* attribute release policies outside 
the confines of a *scope* to freely build and release claims/attributes.  

For example, the following service definition will decide on relevant attribute release policies based on the semantics
of the scopes `profile` and `email`. There is no need to design or list individual claims as CAS will auto-configure
the relevant attribute release policies:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "client",
  "clientSecret": "secret",
  "serviceId" : "...",
  "name": "OIDC",
  "id": 1,
  "scopes" : [ "java.util.HashSet",
    [ "openid", "profile", "email" ]
  ]
}
```

A *scope-free* attribute release policy may just as equally apply, allowing one in 
the following example to release `userX` as a *claim*:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "client",
  "clientSecret": "secret",
  "serviceId" : "...",
  "name": "OIDC",
  "id": 1,
  "attributeReleasePolicy" : {
    "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.ReturnMappedAttributeReleasePolicy",
    "allowedAttributes" : {
      "@class" : "java.util.TreeMap",
      "userX" : "groovy { return attributes['uid'].get(0) + '-X' }"
    }
  }
}
```

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Usage</strong><p>You should consider using a scope-free attribute release policy
only in very advanced and challenging use cases, typically to make a rather difficult client application integration work.</p>
</div>

It is also possible to mix *free-form* release policies with those that operate 
based on a scope by chaining such policies together. For example, the below policy
allows the release of `user-x` as a claim, as well as all claims assigned 
and internally defined for the standard `email` scope.

```json
{
  "@class": "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "client",
  "clientSecret": "secret",
  "serviceId": "...",
  "name": "OIDC",
  "id": 10,
  "attributeReleasePolicy": {
    "@class": "org.apereo.cas.services.ChainingAttributeReleasePolicy",
    "policies": [
      "java.util.ArrayList",
      [
        {
          "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.ReturnAllowedAttributeReleasePolicy",
          "allowedAttributes" : [ "java.util.ArrayList", [ "cn", "uid", "givenName" ] ],
          "order": 0  
        },
        {
          "@class": "org.apereo.cas.services.ReturnMappedAttributeReleasePolicy",
          "allowedAttributes": {
            "@class": "java.util.TreeMap",
            "user-x": "groovy { return attributes['uid'].get(0) + '-X' }"
          },
          "order": 1
        },
        {
          "@class": "org.apereo.cas.oidc.claims.OidcEmailScopeAttributeReleasePolicy",
          "order": 2
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Pairwise Identifiers

When `pairwise` subject type is used, CAS will calculate a unique `sub` value for each sector identifier. This identifier
should not be reversible by any party other than CAS and is somewhat akin to CAS generating persistent anonymous user
identifiers. Each value provided to every relying party is different so as not
to enable clients to correlate the user's activities without permission.

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "client",
  "clientSecret": "secret",
  "serviceId" : "^<https://the-redirect-uri>",
  "subjectType": "pairwise",
  "usernameAttributeProvider" : {
    "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.PairwiseOidcRegisteredServiceUsernameAttributeProvider",
    "persistentIdGenerator" : {
      "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.authentication.principal.OidcPairwisePersistentIdGenerator",
      "salt" : "aGVsbG93b3JsZA=="
    }
  }
}
```

## Subject Identifier Claim

To control and modify the value of the `sub` claim for each OpenID Connect relying party, you may change the application 
definition to returns an attribute that is already resolved for the principal as the `sub` claim value for this service. 

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.OidcRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "client",
  "clientSecret": "secret",
  "serviceId" : "^<https://the-redirect-uri>",
  "scopes" : [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "openid", "profile" ] ]
  "usernameAttributeProvider" : {
    "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.PrincipalAttributeRegisteredServiceUsernameProvider",
    "usernameAttribute" : "cn"
  }
}
```

In general, all other constructs available to CAS that are [described here](../integration/Attribute-Release-PrincipalId.html) which 
control the principal identifier that is shared with a client application may also be used to control the `sub` claim.
